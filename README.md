# calenDar
A calendar app designed to help you organize your 9 to 5 work day.

A calendar that displays the current time and date and updates every second. It displays the time slots for each hour of your 
9 to 5 day. In each hour, you are able to add a note and save your note to local storage if the save button is pressed.

When you are ready to come back to update your day schedule, your previously written notes will be displayed exactly where
you wrote them.
